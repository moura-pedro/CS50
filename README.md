# Academic Honesty

* Remember, this course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as “be reasonable.” The course recognizes that inte-
  ractions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. However, there remains a line between
  enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

* The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except
  to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work
  for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as
  you and they respect this policy’s other constraints. Collaboration on the course’s final project is permitted to the extent
  prescribed by its specification.
